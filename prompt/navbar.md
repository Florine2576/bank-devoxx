I would like to create a Vue3 app that consist of 2 empty pages (only a title at the top) and a navbar. The navbar is described in the cypress test @/cypress/e2e/navbar.cy.ts , it should also respect Hexagonal architecture as described in @/src/HexagonalArchTest.spec.ts . For the visual use the mockup picture I've sent you. Please try to use good practice for css.  Please create different files for css, html and typescript so that the @/src/HexagonalArchTest.spec.ts tests can pass.
